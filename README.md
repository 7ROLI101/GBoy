# GBoy
This is an emulator for the original GameBoy, written in C++11. I decided to use C++11 because there is a chance (not sure if I am going to) that I am going to port this code over to a microcontroller that would be capable of handling this.

This was a project that I wanted to do for a long time now. I decided that now was the time to do it, so that I could improve on my knowledge of what C++11 has to offer. There is a chance that I may move on to the GameBoy Color, but my end goal with emulation is to try and make a GameBoy Advance.

I am going to try and break it down into modules.

-  GBoy:
  - CPU
  - Memory
